-- Moves the domain_conf routine out of settings.php and into hook_init().  This idea, taken from
    the Multidomain module, makes it easier to use the Domain Manager module.

-- Initial commit of the Domain Manager module. This module provides a lightwieght set of tools for
    creating and managing a network of affiliates sites.  The sites run on subdomains of a master domain.
    A single Drupal installation and database are required.  The module uses hook_node_access() to determine
    how content should be presented.  Originally developed for www.skirt.com, the module was introduced
    at DrupalCON Barcelona.
