-- Initial commit of the Domain Manager module. This module provides a lightwieght set of tools for
    creating and managing a network of affiliates sites.  The sites run on subdomains of a master domain.
    A single Drupal installation and database are required.  The module uses hook_node_access() to determine
    how content should be presented.  Originally developed for www.skirt.com, the module was introduces
    at DrupalCON Barcelona.
