1. Who Needs to Upgrade?

If you are using Domain Access prior to 6.x.2.0, then you should
follow these upgrade instructions.

----
2. How to Upgrade

In previous versions, Domain Access asked you to make several
changes to your site's settings.php file.  The 6.x.2.0 version
has made this process easier.

To upgrade, follow the steps below.


STEP  1:  Update the module source code

Replace your existing module files with the new downloaded source.


STEP  2:   Add new code to settings.php

Add the following code to your site's settings.php file:

/**
 * Add the domain module setup routine.
 */
include './sites/all/modules/domain/settings.inc';

See INSTALL.txt for additional information.


STEP  3:  Remove old code from settings.php

If you have any of the following code in settings.php from eariler
versions, you should remove it:

/**
 * Add the custom_url_rewrite_outbound function.
 */
require_once './sites/all/modules/domain/settings_custom_url.inc';

/**
 * Add the domain_conf settings override
 */
require_once './sites/all/modules/domain/domain_conf/settings_domain_conf.inc';

/**
 * Add the domain_prefix tables
 */
require_once './sites/all/modules/domain/domain_prefix/settings_domain_prefix.inc';


STEP  4:  Register the module updates

There is a new variable setting that must be loaded.  To do so, must
visit Admin > Build > Domains from you primary domain.

This action will rebuild the variables needed to run Domain Access.


----
3. Error Notices

If your module is not configured correctly, you should see an error notice
on the top of the page -- this message is shown only to users with the
'administer domains' permission.  The error is also written to your site's
error logs, if any.

If you encourter this error, please check that you have installed or upgraded
the module correctly.  If the problem persists, please file a support request
at http://drupal.org/project/domain
